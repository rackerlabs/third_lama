In this age of big data analytics, new data processing engines are released on a regular basis. Within the context of AWS, the two new services in this space are Athena and Spectrum. How do we choose between them and Redshift given a specific scenario? It is critical to benchmark these services to answer this question. For this hackathon, we plan to conduct a benchmarking study to compare the relative performance between Redshift, Spectrum, and Athena. We will use the standard industry benchmark TPC-H for this comparative study.


## Objectives

 - Automate the data ingestion pipeline so it is easily repeatable
 - Document benchmarking approach and step-by-step process
 - Showcase test results in a consumeable format and provide some analysis to explain the results
